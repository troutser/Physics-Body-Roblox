# Physics Body in Roblox
An implementation of a physics body handler in roblox, made in luau. Made for fun, not exactly the best code for usage. Used to combine with my FABRIK implentation for procedural animation. Inspired and guided by this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPoeNZZ6H4s. Made in 2023, not my best work. Enjoy!
